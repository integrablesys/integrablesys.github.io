            equation by using the Lax linear equations. The wave function
            modulus of the double-periodic solutions is periodic both in space
            and time coordinates; such solutions generalize the standing
            periodic waves which have the time-independent and space-periodic
            wave function modulus. Similar to other waves in the NLS equation,
            the double-periodic solutions are spectrally unstable, and this
            instability is related to the bands of the Lax spectrum outside the
            imaginary axis. A simple numerical method is used to compute the
            unstable spectrum and to compare the instability rates of the
            double-periodic solutions with those of the standing periodic waves.

            homoclinic orbits or constant in the Davey-Stewartson I (DSI)
            equation are studied. These special lumps first emerge from the
            background and then rapidly merge into the background again after
            existing for a very short period. Since these lumps are localized in
            time as well as in two-dimensional spaces, and possess the features
            of rogue wave phenomenon in two-dimensional physics, thus they are
            termed “rogue lumps”. Technically, our derivation of the rogue lumps
            is achieved by a generalization of tau functions into
            multi-component forms in the Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) hierarchy
            reduction method, and this generalized procedure allows us to
            construct the solutions containing rational solitary waves, periodic
            solitons, dark solitons and their mixed solitons in the DSI
            equation. Our results are extensions of doubly localized waves in
